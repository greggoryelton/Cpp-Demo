Compilation and Launching Instructions:
'make' creates an executable 'fp'.
To compile simply enter "make". To run the program enter "./fp".
To delete objects enter "make clean".

Additional Reports:

I did not implement any new reports as I ran out of time, however I did want to compare how many students that graduated went on to do their masters 5 years later.

Notes:
Sometimes my program crashes when trying report 3 after another report has been displayed
